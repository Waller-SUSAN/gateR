## This is the seventh resubmission

* Updates since previous submission:
  * Updated 'spatstat' dependency to include 'spatstat.core' and 'spatstat.geom' because 'spatstat' was recently subsetted
  * Added `p_correct` arugment to `lrren()` and `perlrren()` which calls a new, internal function `pval_correct()` that calculates seven types of corrections for multiple testing
  * Import 'lifecycle' package to document deprecated arguments `doplot` and `verbose` in `lotrrs()`, `rrs()`, and `gating()` functions
  
* Documentation for `pval_correct()` references a doi <https://doi.org/10.2307/2283989> that throws a NOTE in win-builder but no other environment
